    <h6 class=title2>Finished Pad Thai</h6>
    <p class=desctription>Yes! You can make restaurant-worthy pad Thai at home.
        It's not at all hard—it just takes a little strategic planning.
        This one is adapted from Chef Peter of 1001 Thai in Easton, PA.</p>
    <p class=desctription>This classic dish of noodles, egg, veggies, and bean sprouts is
        one you encounter in almost all Thai restaurants—it’s a standard bearer.
        As 48-year-old Chef Pheraphat Phromsom (he goes by Peter) says,
        “If the pad Thai is good, the restaurant is good.”</p>
